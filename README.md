Formula 1 Tracker

CS 441 - Program 2

So this project is essentially uses a JSOUP to access a website ( www.formula1.com) and pulls data from the page source. In this case, I pulled driver name, position, team, and most importantly, the amount of points they have scored so far in the season. 

Then using a listView, we have the drivers all stacked up and the user just need to click on the all the drivers they want to compare and then the FAB to see a bar graph of their progress though out the season.
